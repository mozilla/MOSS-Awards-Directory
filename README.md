# MOSS-Directory (2015-2020)
This is a listing of projects which received awards from the [Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program](https://www.mozilla.org/moss/) and people who sat on the MOSS committees. MOSS broadened access, increased security, and empowered users by providing catalytic funding to open source technologists. Until late 2020, MOSS had three ongoing funding tracks: 1.) Foundational Technology; 2.) Mission Partners; and 3.) Secure Open Source (SOS). **Please note that the MOSS program is on an indefinite hiatus and no new applications for funding are being accepted at this time.** To learn about the impact that MOSS funding had on the open source ecosystem, [please see the MOSS Impact Evaluation Summary](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/research/moss-program-impact-evaluation-2015-2020-summary/).
